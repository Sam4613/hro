### 🧪 Local Testing

#### Before Deploying:
- [ ] Application runs locally without errors
- [ ] All features work (login, dashboard, CRUD operations)
- [ ] Database connection works
- [ ] No Python syntax errors
- [ ] All imports are correct
- [ ] Static files load properly

### 📦 Code Preparation

#### Code Quality:
- [ ] Removed all `print()` debug statements
- [ ] Replaced hardcoded values with environment variables
- [ ] No sensitive data in code (passwords, API keys)
- [ ] All file paths use relative paths
- [ ] Code follows Python best practices

#### File Structure Check:

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create ZIP File
- [ ] Select all project files (not the folder)
- [ ] Create ZIP archive
- [ ] Ensure ZIP is less than 512MB
- [ ] Test ZIP can be extracted properly

### Step 2: AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- [ ] Access Elastic Beanstalk in AWS Console
- [ ] Create new application
- [ ] Choose Python platform
- [ ] Upload ZIP file
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Deploy application

### Step 3: Post-Deployment
- [ ] Check application health (should be green)
- [ ] Test application URL
- [ ] Verify login functionality
- [ ] Test all major features
- [ ] Check logs for any errors

## 🔧 Quick Fixes for Common Issues

### Issue: Application Won't Start
**Check:**
- [ ] `app.py` is in root directory
- [ ] `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- [ ] No syntax errors in Python code
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly

### Issue: Database Connection Failed
**Check:**
- [ ] MongoDB connection string is correct
- [ ] Database user has proper permissions
- [ ] Network access allows all IPs
- [ ] Connection string password is correct

### Issue: Static Files Not Loading
**Check:**
- [ ] `static/` folder is included in ZIP
- [ ] File paths in templates are correct
- [ ] No hardcoded localhost URLs

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working
**Check:**
- [ ] Variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- [ ] Values don't have extra spaces
- [ ] Environment restarted after changes

## 📊 Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Health Checks:
- [ ] Application status is "Ok" (green)
- [ ] No error events in event log
- [ ] Response time is reasonable (<2 seconds)
- [ ] No 5xx errors in logs

### Performance Monitoring:
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch alarms
- [ ] Monitor CPU usage
- [ ] Track memory consumption
- [ ] Watch for error rates

### Security Checks:
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled (if using custom domain)
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Environment variables are secure
- [ ] Database access is restricted

---

## 💰 Cost Management

### Free Tier Monitoring:
- [ ] Using t3.micro instance (free tier eligible)
- [ ] Monitor monthly usage in AWS Billing
- [ ] Set up billing alerts at $5, $10, $20
- [ ] Track data transfer usage

### Cost Optimization:
- [ ] Stop development environments when not in use
- [ ] Use MongoDB Atlas free tier (512MB)
- [ ] Monitor and optimize resource usage
- [ ] Review costs monthly

## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

### If Deployment Fails:
1. [ ] Check application logs in Elastic Beanstalk
2. [ ] Verify all files are included in ZIP
3. [ ] Test application locally first
4. [ ] Check environment variables
5. [ ] Try deploying a previous working version

### If Application is Down:
1. [ ] Check Elastic Beanstalk health dashboard
2. [ ] Review recent events and logs
3. [ ] Restart environment if needed
4. [ ] Check database connectivity
5. [ ] Contact AWS support if needed

### Rollback Procedure:
1. [ ] Go to Elastic Beanstalk console
2. [ ] Click "Application versions"
3. [ ] Select previous working version
4. [ ] Click "Deploy"
5. [ ] Wait for deployment to complete
